# MineSweeper
Building a Minesweeper game in Python is a fun and educational project that combines various programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and user interface design. Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game where the player must uncover hidden mines on a grid using clues provided by adjacent cells. Here's a brief overview of how you can approach building a Minesweeper game in Python:

    1.Setup the Grid: Begin by creating a grid of cells, typically represented as a two-dimensional list or array. Each cell can either be empty or contain a mine. Randomly distribute mines across the grid while ensuring that each cell has an equal chance of being a mine.

    2.Display the Grid: Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) to display the grid of cells to the player. You can use libraries like Tkinter or Pygame for creating the interface.

    3.Handling User Input: Allow the player to interact with the grid by clicking on cells to reveal them. Implement event handling to detect user clicks and update the grid accordingly.

    4.Calculating Clues: Calculate and display clues for each cell based on the number of adjacent cells containing mines. Clues indicate how many mines are adjacent to a particular cell.
